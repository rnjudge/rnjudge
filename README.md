### Hi 👋

I'm Rose and I'm a Senior Open Source Engineer on the OSPO Supply Chain Security team at VMware. As part of my role there I maintain [Tern](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern), a container inspection tool that helps users better understand their container supply chain. I also focus a great deal on open source tooling for Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) and how, as an ecosystem, we can generate and exchange SBOMs more efficiently. Prior to VMware, I worked on embedded Linux distributions at IBM. 

### Open Source 
Most of my work revolves around open source. I'm a contributor to the [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/about/) Tech and Defects specification and lead the SPDX Implementers working group. I'm currently the chair of the [Automating Compliance Tooling](https://github.com/act-project/TAC) Technical Advisory Council and speak at Open Source conferences around the world. I sometimes write [blogs](https://blogs.vmware.com/opensource/?s=rose+judge) for my employer about a variety of Open Source topics, too ([Reproducible builds](https://blogs.vmware.com/opensource/2022/07/14/what-makes-a-build-reproducible-part-2), anyone?). I was even lucky enough to have my open source journey was profiled for the GitHub [ReadME](https://github.com/readme/stories/rose-judge) project. 

### Nonscholastic
When I'm not working from home you'll find me skiing ⛷️, running 🏃‍♀️, or riding my bike 🚴‍♀️ with my family.
