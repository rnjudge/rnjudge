### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rose and I'm an Open Source Engineer at VMware where I'm a maintainer for [Tern](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern), a container inspection tool written in Python that helps users better understand their container supply chain. Prior to VMware, I worked on embedded Linux distributions at IBM. 

### Open Source 
I'm currently the chair of the [Automating Compliance Tooling](https://github.com/act-project/TAC) Technical Advisory Council. I reguarly participate in [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/about/) Tech Team calls, speak at Open Source conferences/events and write [blogs](https://blogs.vmware.com/opensource/?s=rose+judge) for my employer about a variety of Open Source topics.
